Navigate your library of maps with a classification system made specifically for PKM. 

> [!Blocks]- The LYT Classification System
> The **LYT Classification System** is lightly modified from the Cutter, Dewey, and Universal Decimal classification systems used in libraries around the world. It will provide you a time-tested foundation as you structure the interests of your digital library.
> - 000 - *Knowledge Management*
> - 100 - *Personal Management*

> [!NOTE]+ ### 000 - Knowledge Management
> The [[./Meta PKM|Meta PKM]] shows the best practices of knowledge management. I use the [[../Ideaverse Map|Ideaverse Map]] to show the power of linked thinking and to empower others to develop their thinking. The [[Mapping MOCs|Mapping MOCs]] is my personal note to wrap my head around the wondrous beauty that MOCs offer. Others include:
> 
> - [[./Relate|Relate]] | [[Logs (Example)|Logs (Example)]] | [[I want to...|I want to...]]
> - [[Cartographer's Corner ðŸ—º|Cartographer's Corner ðŸ—º]] | [[./Commonplace Book|Commonplace Book]] | [[Knowledge and memory MOC|Knowledge and memory MOC]]

> [!Milestone]+ ### 100 - Personal Management
> The [[Thinking Map|Thinking Map]] can galvanize my attention; the [[./Concepts Map|Concepts Map]] can flavor it; and the [[./Habits Map|Habits Map]] speaks about how to direct it. Hidden within in the [[./Cabin|Cabin]]. Go to my [[./Life Map|Life Map]] to brush up on [[./My Virtues (starter)|My Virtues]] and more.
> 
> - [[Posture MOC|Posture MOC]] | [[Hormesis MOC|Hormesis MOC]] | [[Breathing Exercises MOC|Breathing Exercises MOC]] | Flowcreation MOC
> - People MOC | Family MOC | [[Prominent People (kit)|Prominent People (kit)]]
> - Efforts MOC | [[Life Command âŒ˜|Life Command âŒ˜]] | Plans and Reviews
> - Finances MOC | Health MOC

> [!Puzzle]+ ### 200 - Philosophy, Psychology ; Spirituality, Religion
> Is there no limit to this section? I use [[./Philosophy MOC (kit)|Philosophy MOC (kit)]] as the big note and then point to things like: [[Stoicism MOC|Stoicism MOC]], [[Confucianism MOC|Confucianism MOC]], [[Religion MOC|Religion MOC]], [[Taoism MOC|Taoism MOC]], and whatever else comes up.
> 
> [[./Psychology MOC (kit)|Psychology MOC (kit)]] is similar but different enough to have its own space.

> [!User]+ ### 300 - Social Sciences
> *The study of human society and of individual relationships in and to society.*
> While this a very important section, I have found it's a bit more intimate, as strange as that sounds, so I'm hesitant to share too much here. The best place to start is the [[./People Map|People Map]]. along with.
> 
> See also: [[./People Map#Prominent People ðŸŒ‹|Prominent People ðŸŒ‹]] | Politics | Society | Law | Relationships

> [!Keaton]+ ### 400 - Communications, Language, & Linguistics
> A fun section of the library, the 400s contains the underrated and oft-maligned subject of [[Rhetoric MOC|Rhetoric MOC]]. And one cannot talk long about rhetoric without talking about [[./Language MOC|Language MOC]], [[Words MOC|Words MOC]], and especially [[Figures MOC|Figures MOC]]. Not too far behind is the [[Leadership MOC|Leadership MOC]].

> [!Trees]+ ### 500 - Natural Sciences
> A sharp break from the previous section, the 500s explore the natural world and universe in glorious notes like [[Cosmology MOC|Cosmology MOC]] and [[Math MOC|Math MOC]]. 
> 
> See also: Chemistry | Geology | Plants | Animals | [[./Systems MOC (kit)|Systems MOC (kit)]]

> [!Sailboat]+ ### 600 - Applied Sciences
> A natural progression from the previous section, this is where we take the the fundamentals of nature and *apply* them. My undergrad was in [[Engineering MOC|Engineering MOC]], which relates to my interest in [[Building Homes MOC|Building Homes MOC]]. Later on, I developed the [[Editing Manual MOC|Editing Manual MOC]].

> See also: Agriculture | Technology | Medical | [[AI MOC|AI MOC]] | Programming | [[Collective Intelligence MOC|Collective Intelligence MOC]] | [[Genetics MOC|Genetics MOC]] | 

> [!Play]+ ### 700 - Art & Recreation
> Ah the leisures of life. Remember leisure? Few really do. This section could easily balloon. 
> 
> - Art MOC | [[Design MOC|Design MOC]] | Architecture | Painting | 
> - Film & TV | [[Movies MOC|Movies MOC]] 
> - Sports | [[Football MOC|Football MOC]] 
> - Music | [[Jazz MOC|Jazz MOC]] | [[Vocals MOC|Vocals MOC]] 
> - [[Cooking MOC|Cooking MOC]] | Leisure 

> [!Venetian]+ ### 800 - Literature
> If folks barely remember leisure, they likely completely forgot about classical literature. A great shame, neomaniaâ€¦we blind ourselves to some of humanity's greatest hits. Use [[Literature MOC|Literature MOC]] as a launchpad.

> [!Fingerprint]+ ### 900 - History & Biography & Geography
> I've noticed I'm naturally building up the [[Ancient Greece MOC|Ancient Greece MOC]], but I haven't cared to build out the [[History MOC|History MOC]] just yet. The [[./Places MOC|Places MOC]] is a peculiarly powerful note that has big things in store for it.
> 
> The [[Art & Science Storytelling MOC|Art & Science Storytelling MOC]] look at some great storytellers of history.

Please don't go crazy numbering things. We are just using a pre-made map so we can easily add dots of new interests. 

> [!NOTE]- Some links and content in this note have been removed.
> Because this is a vertical slice of my actual PKM system, I can't include everything in this vault and I left out some notes and material for ease of navigation and understanding the concepts (rather than getting lost in the knowledge) as well as for privacy. 
>  
> Plus, it's okay to have some unlinked notes in your own vault. They won't all be built out at once.
