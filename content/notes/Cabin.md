The cabin is my epicenter.

-

-

-

-

It's where I go to ground myself 🪨.

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

It's where I go to truly orient myself 🧭 .

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

And it's where I visit for spiritual centering 🧲.

-

-

I am connected here ䷤.

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

And I am in no rush to leave…

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

But when I am…

-

I might hike over to the [[./Life Map|Life Map]].
