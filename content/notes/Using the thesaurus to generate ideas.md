 *Let's treat words like ideas*

This is an example of using something as fundamental as WORDS to generate ideas and opinions.

- **Belated**: on time - Ant: punctual — CI: 820
	- Birthday. This makes me think of...Facebook and birthday notifications. 
	- [[Facebook does a lot of harm]]. 
		- [[By amplifying the most emotionally-charged posts, Facebook contributes to actual violence]].
- **Exhaustive**: no stone unturned, all-encompassing, encyclopedic — 531, 772
	- Exhausting, tired, 
	- Wikipedia is fairly exhaustive. It's funny how teachers said not to use it, but now everyone uses it. I guess a question, how do we verify sources? 
- **Quickly**: briskly, rapidly, swiftly — CI: 588, 799
	- Agility, time goes quickly
	- The funny thing about quickly, is that it's never quick enough. [[We chronically underestimate how long something takes]].
