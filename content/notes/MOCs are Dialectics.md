Ideas are often forged in argument where opposing propositions are set against each other. 

This is what happens when notes are placed in a room together and forced to figure things out. 

Ideas bump and jostle. Some combine into something greater. Some split apart and stand on their own. Some are challenged and grow stronger, others are challenged and go away. Some are born into creation out of necessity. 

### MOCs are Dialectics
MOCs create the conditions of a Hegelian dialectic, with you acting as arbiter. Notes enter with some sort of unique idea (Thesis). They encounter conflicts with each other (Antithesis). After many arguments, a generally agreed-upon spatial arrangement is reached (Synthesis).

> [!NOTE]- Some links and content in this note have been removed.
> Because this is a vertical slice of my actual PKM system, I can't include everything in this vault and left out some notes and material for ease of navigation and understanding the concepts (rather than getting lost in the knowledge) as well as for privacy. 
>  
> Plus, it's okay to have some unlinked notes in your own vault. They won't all be built out at once.

This is super powerful. But it's worth considering [[The pros and cons of the Hegelian Dialectic]].

### Consider how MOCs are like Salons
The 18th century "Salons" were strong dialectical environments. Those salons represent a gathering of people to exchange ideas. Let's view salons through the lens of "knowledge management". Salons are:

> A "gathering of ideas" and a "space to allow ideas to interact and"support" or "extend" or "challenge" other ideas" - [[Bob Bain]]

and

> A "sort of emergent democratic process" - [[Steen Comer]]
