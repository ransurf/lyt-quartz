Ideas are forged from thoughts coming together and talking. 

Why not figure out a way to have related thoughts talk to each other more frequently—and at a higher level of intensity?

That's the idea behind the question: 

> How can we maximize "Thought Collisions"?

"**Thought Collisions**" are when you have thoughts interact with other thoughts. 

Their measurement is in the interaction and exchange of ideas. This is largely a metric that can't be measured, but it's still helpful to consider what effective thinking feels like.

Here's the expanded question:

> How can we maximize the ***Frequency, Quality, and Reliability*** of Thought Collisions?

The answer? By using MOCs (Maps of Content). 

MOCs become a tightly-packed room where ideas have to jostle for positioning and figure things out. It's the “the room where it happens".
