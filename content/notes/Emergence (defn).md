 **Emergence** refers to the existence or formation of collective behaviors — what parts of a system do together that they would not do alone. 

To quickly understand this amazing concept, I try to dumb it down and say *“Emergence is adding complexity.”* Or *“Emergence is when the new whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”*

If I was alone in a room, but now I am talking with friends, we are at a higher level of complexity.

-   Me alone equals Emergence Level 1
-   Me with friends equals Emergence Level 2
