A habit is a mirror, it gives what you give itâ€”and what you were given is what you'll give. It's the immediate expression a [[Feedback Loop]].

[[Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia]]. To change a habit requires conscious, deliberate effort. 

As you attempt to change a habit, you have to expend effort to reroute the train. [[Changing a habit is really about replacing a routine]].
