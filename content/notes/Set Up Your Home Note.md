Your Home note is your north star, navigating you to your Maps of Content (MOCs). It keeps the entire system organized.

1. Go to the [[Home]] note. Check it out. 
	- Review the linked notes there.
	- Do you see categories that relate to you?
	- Review the keywords below
1. Now start clicking all the links. Get familiar with the pages. 
	- Do you notice how you can always quickly click back to the Home note (or at least to an MOC, and then back to the Home note)? That's powerful.
	- Do you see any patterns with how some of the Home MOCs are structured? Any you could imagine using?
2. What MOC is a subject you already have notes on? 
	- Start linking your own notes to that existing MOC. 
3. Customize that MOC to your heart's content.

That's the basic process.

Remember, the structure works *for you*, not the other way around (See [[Is LYT For Me]]). You can always just create thousands of notes without looking at the home note once.

### Advanced steps
1. In the [[Home]] note, start customizing the links to suit your personal needs. Less is more at the start of your journey. A bulleted list can be faster to work in (and easier to maintain) than a complicated table.
2. Play around, break things. Some categories you thought would work won't. That's fine, just rejigger things until they work better for you.
