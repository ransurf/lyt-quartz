This is where I keep tabs on some of the sources I have encountered. 
What "sources" should you track? 
How about books and movies?

For the Fall 2023 Ideaverse, I am playing around with a property field called `type`. It allows me a nice way to create a few passive maps for different types of sources. Here's what I have so far, feel free to make more:

- [[./Book|Book]] | [[./Game|Game]] | [[./Movie|Movie]] | [[./Paper|Paper]] | [[./Song|Song]] | [[./Speech|Speech]]

For more ideas, check out the tags pane. Find "source" and twirl it down. The sources I have decided to include tracking over the years include: *books, movies, songs, research papers, plays, paintings, quotes, videos, speeches, poems, tweets, articles, and newsletters*. 

> [!Script]- ## ALL SOURCES
> This is a simple data view pulling anything from the **Sources** folder.

>  | Year | Type | Source |
> | ---- | ---- | ------ |

Not included here, but in my personal vault, I enjoy checking out the comprehensive [[Source MOC|Source MOC]] and perusing my [[Bookshelf ğŸ“š|Bookshelf ğŸ“š]]. And to honor the old ones, I also keep a [[./Commonplace Book|Commonplace Book]] based on tags.
