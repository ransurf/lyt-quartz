 *The longer I'm around, the longer I'll be around*

- The longer a non-perishable thing has been around, the longer it will be around. Like the spoon. Not like the human. 
- There is no spoon...unless you're talking about the Lindy Effect. Then there is a spoonâ€”and it will be around for at least another couple million years.
- Things that have been around for a long time (and are non-perishable) are not "aging" like people, but "aging" in reverse.
- The older something valuable is, the more likely it will still be valuable in 100 years.
- This is strongly related to [[Antifragility]].

### Practical Usage
- *Let the cream rise to the top before you take a sip*: I use this when I let the cream of the TV series rise to the top, garnering end-of-year awards before choosing to watch them. ^d5abb0

### Wiki
The Lindy effect is a concept that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.  
Where the Lindy effect applies, mortality rate decreases with time.
