ACE is the most universal folder system to help you to learn, remember, and create.

The thing is, it's more than just a folder system. I just talk about it that way because that's what everybody wants. But ***ACE is really about the head spaces we orient our thoughts around.*** There are three. The table below will help provide perspective.

| Headspace        | Orienting Lens | Intention     | Organizing Principle | Underlying Benefit | Guiding Question              |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Atlas**    | Knowledge      | To Understand | Relatedness / Space                | Learn / Remember             | _Where would you like to go?_ |
| **Calendar** | Time           | To Focus      | Time                 | Remember / Reflect          | _What's on your mind?_        |
| **Efforts**  | Action         | To Act        | Importance           | Create             | _What can you work on?_       |

> [!NOTE]+ Test your folder structure slowly
> Do less now. I strongly encourage deferring any "great customizations" for later, and just using the pre-provided ACE framework in the short-term. Why? Because *structure must be earned*, and pre-structuring for an entire day just leads to a fragile building that will break in a week.
