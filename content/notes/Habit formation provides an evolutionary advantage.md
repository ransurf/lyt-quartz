Whenever we take an action, neurons fire and strengthen their connections. Then, when we repeat that same action, it  miraculously requires less effort. How can this be?!

It's because Nature's [[Selfish Gene]] has a prime directive to survive—which means to become more efficient—so whatever you do once, is easier to do a second time.

By making a repeated action more efficient, less energy is used, less willpower is required[^1], and fewer calories are burned—all of which lead to a better chance of survival. 

Bad habits and good habits are nothing more than a bunch of self-perpetuating [[Feedback Loop]]s that have grown efficient over time, with deeply enmeshed neural connections. In this way, "Passing mental states become lasting neural traits”.[^2]

To quit a bad habit, don't try to stop it like Superman; you'll fail. [[Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia]] in the form of built-up neural efficiencies in the brain (see [[Cobwebs into Cables]]). Instead, try to co-opt it by shifting the tracks. See [[Changing a habit is really about replacing a routine]].

While "habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage", it doesn't necessarily form in the ways you might think—meaning, *your "self" optimizes for what you repeat, regardless of whether or not it's "good" for you.*
