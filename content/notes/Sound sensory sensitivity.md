Enjoyed the thinking process around [Sensory quietness for the soul - by Fei-Ling Tseng](https://feeei.substack.com/p/sensory-quietness-for-the-soul?s=r), as it stacks up with my experiences around sound. I wonder if people in the PKM space may be more sensitive to sound than the average. Also, sound radars give me hope.
