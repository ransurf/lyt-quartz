 **Micro Habits**: These are super tiny, hidden habits that happen without us usually being aware of them; but that can majorly impact our state of mind.

Micro Habits happen at a moment called "The Point of Contact"

**The Point of Contact**
The Point of Contact (POC) is not a contact you have with an external stimulus. Rather, it's a contact with your *internal response* to an external stimulus. 

It's an emotion, thought, feeling, impulse or bodily sensation exerting an influence on your current state of mind.

If you can bring awareness to your micro habits during these consequential points of contact, you can make sure not to get derailed by them. 

The POC emerges out of the fog of the subconscious. Sometime we pinpoint it sooner than other times. Whenever we do, we engage the dual-mind.

**The Dual Mind**
The Dual Mind refers to the conscious/subconscious minds. 

We need to develop the skills, awareness, and intuition to identify POCs that can derail our day; so we can effectively deal with them like a master in [[Aikido]] would.

#### Two Micro Habits to improve:
1. Recognize harmful POCs
2. Effectively deal with harmful POCs

This is about *winning the point of contact*. The answers for both are usually just a few questions:

- What is it I'm feeling right now? Why is that? 
- How much do I want these feelings to consume my attention?
