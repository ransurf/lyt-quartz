 *A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.*
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these **conceptual** collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas. 

## Daily reminders of powerful concepts
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[./OODA Loop|OODA Loop]], [[./Levels of Magnification|Levels of Magnification]], and [[./Refraction Thinking|Refraction Thinking]]. 

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[./Reps|Reps]], creating the conditions for [[./Flow|Flow]], which involves environmental [[./Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[./Shadow Clone|Shadow Clone]].

[[./Natural Selection|Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[./Lindy Effect|Lindy Effect]], along with [[./Hormesis|Hormesis]] and [[./Antifragility|Antifragility]]â€”and also more broadly [[./Cause and Effect|Cause and Effect]]. This reminds me of [[./Concept Expansion|Concept Expansion]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[./Yin and Yang|Yin and Yang]], [[./Synthesis|Synthesis]], [[./Seasons|Seasons]], and the [[./Mountain Top Water Drop|Mountain Top Water Drop]]. Dealing with folks in the entertainment industryâ€”and just throughout life reallyâ€”there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[./No-Face|No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[./The Id|The Id]]. [[./Aikido|Aikido]] is good to remember. 

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspective, try to revisit the [[./Rubik's Cube|Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[./Munger's Mental Models|Munger's Mental Models]].
