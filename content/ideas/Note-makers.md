Note-makers are people who spend their thinking time in an active, engaged wayâ€”making sense of the stuff they encounter. 

They don't try foolishly try to collect every piece of data they come across. Instead, as they encounter information, they think about it creatively, critically, and connectively.

This creates a positive feedback loop to encourage more active, engaged thinking!

Along with note-makers just generally being more interesting people to be around, they also are able to contribute much more value to their families, communities, and society as a whole.

Contrast this ideal of the note-maker with the pandemic of [[Note-takers]].
