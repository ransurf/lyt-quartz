There is an art to handling self-perpetuating aggressiveness. 

Aikido deflects and dissipates an attacker's energy.

In this way, Aikido relates to [[No-Face]] and [[The Id]]. This form of energy manipulation happens all the time in "Rhetorical Jujutsu".

### Wiki
Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art developed by Morihei Ueshiba as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy and religious beliefs. Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury. Aikido is often translated as "the way of unifying life energy" or as "the way of harmonious spirit".
