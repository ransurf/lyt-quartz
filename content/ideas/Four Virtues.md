I have found that a better way to look at Virtues is less as Values and more as "Abilities," because it implies that it's not enough to value something, you have to be skilled in it. 

Out of many schools of thought, I have found that using the Stoic Virtues as a base, aligned the best with my way of thinking. Below are the most valuable virtues in which to be really skilled:

- **Wisdom** — includes good sense, good calculation, quick-wittedness, discretion, resourcefulness, financial intelligence, gratitude, and knowing on what to spend attention.
    - Prioritizing Attention — creating clarity and prioritizing with purpose where to deliberately spend attention
    - Financial Excellence — includes financial prudence and intelligence
    - Gratitude — includes love, thankfulness, thinking outside oneself
- **Courage** — includes vulnerability, confidence, love, endurance, high-mindedness, cheerfulness, will, kindness, and industriousness
- **Morality** — includes justice, integrity, honesty, kindness, and fair dealing
    Kindness — includes love, empathy, compassion, warmth, openness
- **Moderation** — includes temperance, moderation (good discipline, seemliness, modesty, and self-control), good balance of activity and life roles, good management of yin/yang
