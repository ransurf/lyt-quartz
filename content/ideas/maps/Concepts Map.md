 *A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.*
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these **conceptual** collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas. 

## Daily reminders of powerful concepts
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[OODA Loop]], [[Levels of Magnification]], and [[Refraction Thinking]]. 

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Shadow Clone]].

[[Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Lindy Effect]], along with [[Hormesis]] and [[Antifragility]]â€”and also more broadly [[Cause and Effect]]. This reminds me of [[Concept Expansion]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Yin and Yang]], [[Synthesis]], [[Seasons]], and the [[Mountain Top Water Drop]]. Dealing with folks in the entertainment industryâ€”and just throughout life reallyâ€”there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[The Id]]. [[Aikido]] is good to remember. 

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspective, try to revisit the [[Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Munger's Mental Models]].
