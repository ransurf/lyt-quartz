Life happens. Sometimes we're on top of the world, other times the world is on top of us. Around May 2018, the world was on top of me. I felt an instinctual pull to rebuild some routine and structure into my day. Due to my undiagnosed condition to nounify everything, I began to refer to these practices as *Resiliency Routines*. Others who have read Duhigg might refer to them as "Keystone Habits"[^1]. Normal people might just say "things I do in the morning and at night." 

For me, in the briefest rendition, it just meant waking up earlier than normal, journaling, and working out. I had one unfair super tool in my arsenal: access to a sauna. So every morning resulted in a sauna-workout. 

In the sauna one morning I recognized that I was: *unhappy, unbalanced, and unproductive*. My morning trifecta—wake early, journal, and workout—helped remove the “un” from those prefixes. 

1. Wake early
2. Journal
3. Workout

This is a simple reminder that the solution to not feeling so overwhelmed starts with some simple actions.
