Something amazing happens when you start linking your digital notes. You develop the muscle to make leaps of insights across domains of knowledge. It's truly a super powerâ€”and a habit worth cultivating in today's age because "value" is created when strangers on a plane start talking. 

As you make rare and unique connections between different disciplines, you start to think more holistically about the underlying patterns inherent in both. These leaps of insight are not only fun, but they are all potential sources of new value creation (along with making you more interesting to interact with).

A hidden benefit of deliberately linking your thinking is that [[Note-making creates unexpected optionality]].
