Note-making is a process for:

1. idea creation and connection
2. the strengthening of note retrieval
3. the clever use of spaced repetition

Can I share with you the basic process?
## A step-by-step note-making walkthrough
- I pulled in this old note from my pre-Obsidian zettelkasten. 
	- [[2015-02-20 Habit Concepts and Theory]]
- It's rough and less useful than it could be.
- I made a new note to work in, and eventually it became this:
	- [[The neural formation of habits is additive - v1]]
- Now I have an evergreen note.
- Can you see why the second note is so much more valuable?
- Because now I can return to this note and add more valuable to it over time. 
- That's what I did. A few days later, I returned to that note and developed it further:
	- [[The neural formation of habits is additive]]
- "Wait a second!" You say. "Where did most of it go?"
- That's the beauty. Through the *note-making* process, I realized my note was actually trying to say multiple things. 
- And since I wanted to be able to link to each idea separately, I made them into separate notes. Here's the other one:
	- [[The truest habit metaphors are additive]]
- But wait there's more! 
- This process actually encouraged me to generate new ideas.
- It also encouraged me to link these ideas to other ideas. (This is crazy powerful). 
- Suddenly, I couldn't believe what I put together:
	- [[Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage]]
	- [[Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia]]
- Those are powerful notes!
- Creating one living note oftentimes spawns new insights for more living notes.
- And that's the power of making living notes in the process known as **note-making**.

Boom! That's it.

## Evergreen notes lead to MOCs
But that's seriously just the beginning, because now I want to introduce you to the most revolutionary thinking tool in the "*age of the linked note*"!

What am I even talking about here?  

I'm talking about **Maps of Content**—also known as MOCs.

You simple must go through the [[The 3 Phases of MOCs]] to learn more about how to enhance your *note-making* using MOCs.

Before you click that link though, let's finish the big picture. 

Do you see at the top of this note, how I have a link "up" to the [[Ideaverse Map]]? There is something powerful in linking your notes together. It allows you lightning fast navigation—especially back to your Home note. In this case, it's simple:

- This note, [[On the process of note-making]]
	- ...leads back to [[Ideaverse Map]]...
		- ...which leads back to the [[Home]] note!

That means I've created a star map where I can make hyperspace jumps between different levels of "Idea Emergence" in just a few clicks.

Pretty awesome in my opinion.
