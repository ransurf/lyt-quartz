Being able to think fluidly gives you the awareness and skill to think from the right level of abstraction at the right time.

> **Fluid Thinking** is the ability to skillfully adjust your perspective— zooming in and out of the levels of emergence. This allows you to approach a problem from the inside and the outside…tacking back and forth with ease to generate new value and find novel solutions.

That opens up a lot a whole new ability to think fluidly and flexibly, and to accomplish a lot more in a lot less time, and have a lot more fun doing it.

- Sometime you start from the *bottom-up*: `Note » MOC » Home`
- Sometime you start from the *top-down*: `Home » MOC » Note`
- Sometimes you start from the *middle-out*: `MOC » Note` & `MOC » Home`

Let's use all three. That's the goal. ==The goal is Fluid Thinking.==

PS: My MO is MO.
