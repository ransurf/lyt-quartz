There are four useful intensities for your efforts. 

- üî• `On`: For the most active efforts & projects
- ‚ôªÔ∏è `Ongoing`: For broader, ongoing efforts
- „Äú `Simmering`: For back of mind efforts
- üí§ `Sleeping`: For everything else (random, done, cold storage, etc)

Viewing your efforts through the lens of ***intensities*** allows you to:

- See a truer estimation of your current efforts.
- Effectively prioritize your efforts at a glance.  
- Quickly adjust your bandwidth as needed.

Twirl down `On` and `Ongoing`. Too much going on? Move an effort from `On` to `Simmering`. 

There, feel better? 

So what's the secret?

We are taking the condition of "**Intensity**" and making it both visible and tangible. 

For as much complexity as there can be in PKM, managing efforts ***by intensity*** can give you immediate clarity, calm, and control over your efforts in life.
