 **Idea Emergence** is the process of how the ideas you encounter go from the "nothingness" to the "somethingness"â€”and how those ideas grow in richness, complexity, and personally meaningful value over time.

- Idea Emergence is how value forms from mixing a person's (or persons') experiences with their uniqueness. 
- Idea Emergence is where past things combine with new situations and something distinct emerges.

In "Personal Knowledge Management, there are 5 Emergence Levels.
