An asymptotic curve is seen in the development of habits, skills,  muscles, and more.

The asymptotic curve rises fast on the y-axis before leveling out. Practically, this models the rate of improvement when we start a new habit or develop a new skill.

Initial improvement is rapid but then slows down before plateauing. If we don't change up our actions, that slow down will reach the [[Point of Diminishing Returns]] and become a plateau.[^2]

The a-curve models the following:
- skill development (reference Ericsson 1993)
- Strength Development
- memory development via spaced repetition (the inverse of which is the "forgetting curve") (See: [[How the LYT System enriches Spaced Repetition]]) ^ab3d72
- habit formation
- attention spans

[^2]: This also relates, in general, to the [[Pareto Principle]], although I'd say for the a-curve it's more like the final 10% of the task takes as long as the prior 90%. Remember both points when "fighting perfectionism".
