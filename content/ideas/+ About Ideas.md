The ideas folder is one of my favorite places because it has *umami*. Apparently umami is one of the five basic tastes. There are: Sweetness, Sourness, Saltiness, Bitternessâ€”and that oddball Umami.

Umami is hard to describe but you know when it's there. The same is true of this folder's contents. It's a mixture of insights and ideas, concepts and connections, all mingling together to create that mysterious full mouthfeel that magnificently completes any meal for the mind. 

***Q: So, what are "ideas"?*** 
Anything that is a bit of knowledge that you might call a "thing" or a "statement about things". 

Yes, the definition is not rigid, but it works. 

[[Information that crosses our attentional filter becomes knowledge]].
