 **Progressive Ideation** is the process of relating and developing ideas over time. 

Through this process, your thinking efforts naturally compound.

I'm kind of thinking this might be better called [[Organic ideation]]. 
- The advantage of PI is that it sounds like there is an attainable 3-4 step process, whereas OI sounds potentially like it might not solve a person's workflow issues.

This is where the NoMa Method and Progressive Ideation start taking up the same mental space. (Let's throw in Conceptual Note-making for fun too.) 

I think the underlying principle is PI, while the front-facing method is NoMa.
