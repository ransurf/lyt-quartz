This is my true love. You will either love this theme, or avoid it at all costs.

Although it’s inspired by the retro craze, it’s crazy how useful it actually is. I get an incredible amount of work accomplished in it. As the creator of Cybertron once said:

> I do both my creative and analytical work in Cybertron.

It derives inspiration from:
1. Dynalist
2. Cyberpunk 2077
3. Synthwave
4. Keanu Reeves
5. The Terminator

## Cool Aspects
While stylized, I actually find Cybertron to be extremely practical. It seems to encourage creativity. 

###### Notables
- Dark mode only
- **Bold** has its own color
- *Italics* has its own color
- It's preferred that you use the plugin Sliding Panes

### Testing it out
I use **Bold Words** for calling out nouny things (most of the time), and I'll use *italics* for drawing emphasis to words (nothing out of the ordinary there). 

#### Other things you might want to know
- I wouldn't normally use so many categories because they can quickly get in the way, but I'm trying to show you the theme, so don't judge!
	- Cybertron is paired well while listening to nightride.fm. 


##### And then there was a cassette player
Working your way around bumpy bumps and stumpy stumps, your foot knocks against something. "That's not a rock," is your first thought, followed quickly by, "That's the sound of cheap plastic!" You look down and find a dusty cassette player. You've heard about these from your grandpa. After some time (longer than you'd like to admit), you find the eject button, and study the tape inside. On the back side, scrawled in blue pen, are the words: "In case of a focus emergency". You put the tape back in and [[In case of a focus emergency|press play]].
