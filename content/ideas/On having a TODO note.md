Usually, the people who are "Daily Notes" practitioners also like tagging their entries with `[[TODO]]` or `#task`. I recommend using a different app to fully manage your projects and tasks.

But if you won't be deterred, here is a way to handle tasks in markdown.

- `[[TODO]]` - Use this to manage your tasks
- `#task` - Use a tag like this if you don't want to rely on backlinks to surface tasks or muddy up your graph with task-related connections.
- `[[done]]` - Change `[[TODO]]` to `[[done]]` if you care about keeping a log the stuff you've completed.

> [!NOTE]- Some links and content in this note have been removed.
> Because this is a vertical slice of my actual PKM system, I can't include everything in this vault and left out some notes and material for ease of navigation and understanding the concepts (rather than getting lost in the knowledge) as well as for privacy. 
>  
> Plus, it's okay to have some unlinked notes in your own vault. They won't all be built out at once.

Just to reiterate, I prefer to not clutter my ideas with tasks. Ideas are built for long-term value; whereas tasks provide very short-term value. Also, [[people who are led by a task manager cut off their intuition]].
