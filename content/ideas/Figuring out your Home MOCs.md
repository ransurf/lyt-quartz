Your Maps of Content (MOCs) in your Home note are just your main launchpads into your ideaverseâ€”your custom network of knowledge and your creativity engine. 

Your MOCs should be broad. At first, you'll probably only need 2-3. Try to stay below 10 or so. They are easy to change and rename to your heart's content.
