 *"Reps, Reps, Reps."*   ^dbdd21

Learning, improving, deliberate practice…the underpinning of it all—the unspoken current flowing through any progression—is getting reps, in all forms, consistently and frequently.

In practicing a craft, just show up, and get reps: tiny reps, technical reps, reps from questions, reps by observation, reps by research, reps, reps, consistent, persistent reps! 

Repetitions strengthen neural pathways, which I think of in terms of [[Cobwebs into Cables]].

When working on a specific craft, and when you've passed a threshold of basic competence, then it's valuable to identify specific areas to work on and to drill them deliberately. This is called [[Deliberate Practice]], a term coined by the "expert on experts" [[K. Anders Ericsson (kit)]].
